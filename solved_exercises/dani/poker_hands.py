"""
Establish which kind of Poker combination is present in a deck of five cards.
Every card is a string containing the card value (with the upper-case initial
for face-cards) and the lower-case initial for suits, as in the examples below:

"Ah" ➞ Ace of hearts
"Ks" ➞ King of spades
"3d" ➞ Three of diamonds
"Qc" ➞ Queen of clubs

There are 10 different combinations.

Here's the list, in decreasing order of importance:

Name            Description
Royal Flush     A, K, Q, J, 10, all with the same suit.
Straight Flush  Five cards in sequence, all with the same suit.
Four of a Kind  Four cards of the same rank.
Full House      Three of a Kind with a Pair.
Flush           Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.
Straight        Five cards in a sequence, but not of the same suit.
Three of a Kind Three cards of the same rank.
Two Pair        Two different Pair.
Pair            Two cards of the same rank.
High Card       No other valid combination.


Given a list hand containing five strings being the cards, implement a function
that returns a string with the name of the highest combination obtained,
accordingly to the table above.

Examples
poker_hand_ranking(["10h", "Jh", "Qh", "Ah", "Kh"]) ➞ "Royal Flush"
poker_hand_ranking(["3h", "5h", "Qs", "9h", "Ad"]) ➞ "High Card"
poker_hand_ranking(["10s", "10c", "8d", "10d", "10h"]) ➞ "Four of a Kind"
